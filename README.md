A responsive Usability Hub clone implemented in HTML and CSS is a web application that closely replicates the user interface and design of Usability Hub, a platform for usability testing, while ensuring adaptability to different screen sizes and devices. This clone offers users the ability to simulate usability tests and collect feedback on their designs, just like the original platform, but with the added benefit of being accessible and visually pleasing on a wide range of devices, including desktop computers, tablets, and smartphones. The responsiveness is achieved through CSS media queries, making it user-friendly and accessible across various platforms and screen resolutions.
